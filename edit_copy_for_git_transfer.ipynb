        "Insurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim.

As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n",
